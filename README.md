# The-new-web-clone

A front-end exercise to practice responsive design.

The instructions can be found here:
https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-responsive-design?ref=lnav

And the origin website here:

This project is really good to learn how to make a website responsive
(using 'em' and percentage instead of fixed pixels, flexbox and media queries).
